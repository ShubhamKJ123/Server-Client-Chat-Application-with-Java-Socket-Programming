# Server Client Chat Application with Java Socket Programming
The projects emphasizes the use of TCP sockets in JAVA. Like any Client/Server application here I assigned an IP & port to the server and successfully established 4 parallel clients using the IP and Port of the server.
There are multiple clients connected to the server and they can chat to each other, just like in a chat room where everyone can see other users’ messages. There’s no private chat between two users(for simplicity)
